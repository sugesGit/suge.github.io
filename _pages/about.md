I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Software Technology at Zhejiang University, affiliated with the ACES research team.

In 2025, I obtained my PhD from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor Jianwei Yin and co-supervised by Professor Shuiguang Deng. My primary research focuses on multimodal learning, data mining and intelligent healthcare, with a particular emphasis on large vision-language models in the intelligent regulatory tasks.
