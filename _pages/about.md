<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Software Technology at Zhejiang University, affiliated with the ACES research team.

In 2025, I obtained my PhD from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor <a href='https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/0001038/'> Jianwei Yin </a> and co-supervised by Professor <a href='https://person.zju.edu.cn/shuiguang/'> Shuiguang Deng </a>. My primary research focuses on multimodal learning, data mining and intelligent healthcare, with a particular emphasis on large vision-language models in the intelligent regulatory tasks.
